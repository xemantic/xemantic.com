## Invitation

### Do you want to learn how to build your own AI agents?

We are [Xemantic](https://xemantic.com/), offering intensive one-day workshops on **building powerful AI agents**. Your instructor, [Kazik Pogoda](#about-kazik-your-instructor), will take you on a journey of developing autonomous and highly potent AI systems, like [Claudine AI agent](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine/), capable of fully controlling your machine. Claudine won [AI hack Berlin](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/ai-hack-berlin) hackathon.

## What You Will Learn

- Master the essential **glossary** of AI development terms
- Build **custom conversational bots** using the [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/) as a foundation for agent development
- Design and **engineer prompts for agents**, moving beyond simple conversational AI — natural language becomes your new programming paradigm
- Extract **structured output** from unstructured sources through model parsing (e.g. documents, images)
- Give **tools to your agent** (function calling), so it can interact with your machine
- How to **integrate an agent with IT systems** of your organization (discussion with examples)
- How to assist [Claudine](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine) agent in using your computer and autonomous coding - where traditional roles of human and machine are reversed.
- Understand the architecture and meta-principles of powerful AI agents
- Apply Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), which standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.
- Navigate AI ethics, privacy, security, and alignment considerations

*You'll gain access to a tailored workshop repository featuring approachable, well-documented examples and blueprints. These are illustrated using the [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org/) creative coding framework (to which we are contributors), making them both self-explanatory and engaging.*

## Backstory

Machines are becoming more intelligent every day, and keeping pace with their exponential advancement has become a full-time endeavor. We are entering the **Agentic AI era**, which creates unprecedented possibilities for software developers to integrate systems with autonomous, non-human reasoning.

At Xemantic, we conduct independent AI research through the lens of applied philosophy. This work has led to unique discoveries and an extensive collection of [open source AI libraries](../#xemantics-open-source-ai-software). These tools make Agentic AI development highly approachable, especially for developers working with the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and Java/JVM stack.

*Not familiar with Kotlin? Don't worry — the workshop begins with an optional Kotlin crash course, and all code examples are minimal and self-explanatory. **What matters here is not the implementation language but the meta-theory of writing powerful AI agents, which is the main focus of the workshop.***

We had a chance of validating the value of our research during the [AI hack Berlin](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/ai-hack-berlin) hackathon at Google. Together with [Victor Diaz](https://github.com/victordiaz) we formed our *ad hoc* "Robots will steal your food" team, which presented an autonomous AI agent, freely controlling a remote Unix machine, according to intentions expressed in simple sketches created by the user in the web browser. Our team won the hackathon.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What level of programming experience is required?

Our workshop is designed to be accessible to developers of all skill levels. The key requirements are:

- Basic programming concepts understanding (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, Java, Scala, Rust, C, C++, etc.)
- Ability to express ideas in natural language
- Willingness to learn and experiment

The [workshop repository](https://github.com/xemantic/xemantic-ai-workshop) features self-explanatory Kotlin code that follows a "clone, modify, play" approach. **Natural language skills are more crucial than advanced programming expertise** for this workshop. Many examples are presented together with their Python and TypeScript version.

*Beginners are encouraged to attend the optional Kotlin crash course at 10:00.*

### Do you offer on-site corporate workshops?

Yes! We can deliver the workshop at your company location.

- For organizers: Contact us directly at <office@xemantic.com>
- For employees: Share our workshop page (<https://xemantic.com/ai/workshops>) with your team leader or HR department

### Is it possible to take part in the workshop remotely?

We are working on that. Depending on popularity, we might also consider a pre-recorded version of the workshop published on YouTube.

### Why Kotlin for AI Development?

Kotlin offers unique advantages for AI development:

1. **Powerful Language Features**
    - [Domain-Specific Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) support
    - Our [anthropic-sdk-kotlin](https://github.com/xemantic/anthropic-sdk-kotlin) simplifies LLM integration
    - [Extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html#extension-functions) for elegant APIs

2. **Developer-Friendly**
    - Clean, minimal syntax
    - Reduced boilerplate code
    - Excellent for learning and teaching

3. **Technical Benefits**
    - [Multiplatform support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) for cross-platform deployment
    - [Type inference](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/type-inference.html) for concise code
    - Optimal for LLM code generation

*While Kotlin AI libraries are currently limited, we're actively working to expand the ecosystem.*

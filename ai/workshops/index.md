- Development of AI agents which can interact with the world.
- How to write agentic prompts for creative purposes.

## Backstory



Machines are becoming more intelligent with every single day and keeping up with their advancement is becoming a job on its own. We are entering the Agentic AI era, which creates unprecedented possibilities for software developers, to integrate our systems with machine-based autonomous reasoning. 

Together with Victor Diaz we just won AI Hack Berlin hackathon while introducing the team "Robots will steal your food", which presented an autonomous, omnipotent, open source AI agent named

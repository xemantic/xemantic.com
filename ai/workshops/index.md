## Invitation

Hello, we are <a href="https://xemantic.com/">Xemantic</a>, applied philosophy collective from Berlin, and we would like to invite you to our workshop, where you will learn <b>how to write powerful AI agents</b>. Your instructor, [Kazik Pogoda](#about-your-instructor), will take you on a journey of developing autonomous and highly potent AI systems, like [Claudine AI agent](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine/), the winner of AI hack Berlin hackathon, capable of fully controlling a Unix-compliant machine:

## You will learn ...

- A glossary of AI related terms.
- How to write custom conversational bot?
- How to utilize so-called structured generation?
- How to give agent tools, so it can interact with your machine?
- How to adapt these tools to IT systems and needs of your organization?
- How to assist Claudine AI in using your computer and coding (indeed, the roles are reversing)?
- Ethical alignment

All of this as approachable as possible, illustrated with elements of creative coding for boosting fun factor and accessibility.

## Backstory

Machines are becoming more intelligent with every single day and keeping up with their advancement is becoming a job on its own. We are entering the Agentic AI era, which creates unprecedented possibilities for software developers, to integrate our systems with machine-based autonomous reasoning.

Since few months I've been conducting my independent AI research, which led me to some unique discoveries, and resulted in plethora of [open source AI libraries](../ai), which make creation of Agentic AI super-approachable, especially for Kotlin and Java/JVM stack developers.

Together with [Victor Diaz]() we won AI Hack Berlin hackathon, while introducing the team "Robots will steal your food", which presented an autonomous, omnipotent, open source AI agent named

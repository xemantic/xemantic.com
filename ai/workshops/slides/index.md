## Xemantic

Xemantic is a collective of applied philosophy based at [Prachtsaal](https://prachtsaal.berlin) cooperative, founded by Julia Thomas and Kazik Pogoda, conducting independent AI research and creating immersive computational art.

We publish our research as open source software.

## About Kazik

I used to work at Bonial as lead developer of the legendary Team 42!

_I heard that you are still using some of the common libraries I developed back then ;)_

## Which AI tech are you using at Bonial?

- Generative AI
- Vision models
- AI assisted development
- Retrieval augmented generation
- AI agents

---
## Agentic AI

What makes an AI agent, **the difference between "a workflow" and "an agent"**:

https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents

---
## Why Anthropic?
### instead of OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral

* Structured generation/output
* Claude Sonnet 3.5 - the first model which made truly autonomous agentic use cases feasible (SWE-Bench) 
* They just dropped Claude 3.7

_We invested in building anthropic-sdk-kotlin, good intuition regarding who will lead the AI race._

# Why is it even possible?

---
## Emergence

From evolutionary processes around we learn, that self-replicating systems composed of individual elements, when reaching certain level of complexity, start exhibiting properties and phenomena which we cannot reduce to properties of individual elements.

_Maybe we should study biology before computer science? ;)_

---
## New phenomena in Machine Learning

_from ML to AI_

- scaling laws (just throw more compute at it...)
- emergent reasoning
- emergent theory of mind

---
## The tectonic paradigm shift

... in virtually everything, but it starts with software

---
### Are robots gonna steal our job?

It's a very complex topic, noone can tell, but most likely **the opposite will happen**.

For sure, we need to adapt, and we need to adapt extremely fast.

---
### What does Agentic AI imply for software development?

**Stop the world! ... and rethink.**

We are at the tipping point. Every project we are working on at the moment might be obsolete when we release it.

---
## Rethink the tools we are using

"AI-assisted development" vs "assisting AI in development"

---
### Agentic AI principles

1. A language model with emergent reasoning capabilities.
2. Well documented (therefore internalized by the model) information exchange standard.
3. Vast amount of data to operate on.

What can you substitute for these categories at Bonial?

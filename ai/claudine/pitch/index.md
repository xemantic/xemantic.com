# Claudine AI Agent
Towards autonomous and omnipotent agentic AI

---
## About Claudine

> [Claudine](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine/) is an open source research prototype of an autonomous **omnipotent** AI agent, which already won highly competitive [AI hack Berlin hackathon](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/ai-hack-berlin) at Google HQ, sponsored by many other key AI companies, which also formed the jury. The agent can fully control a [Unix-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) machine, therefore perform any task a human agent could do with such a system.

## Examples of what Claudine can do

- research the internet, call APIs
- write and update documents and contracts
- exchange information with 3rd parties
- administer OS, Cloud, Databases, etc.
- develop complete software products
- self-modify by coding new tools for itself

---
## The Problem
* Organizations increasingly need AI expertise but face high costs for specialized talent
* Small organizations struggle to access AI capabilities that could help them thrive
* Current AI agents are limited to specific workflows rather than being true autonomous agents

---
## How Claudine came into being?
* Developed through independent research in philosophy and cognitive science ([Xemantic](https://xemantic.com))
* Built on years of experience in software development, architecture and system administration, and building NGOs
* The whole [ecosystem of open source tools](https://xemantic.com/ai/) has been developed to make Claudine possible

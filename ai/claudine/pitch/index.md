# Claudine AI Agent
Towards autonomous and omnipotent agentic AI

---
## About Claudine

> [Claudine](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine/) is an open source research prototype of an autonomous **omnipotent** AI agent, which already won highly competitive [AI hack Berlin hackathon](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/ai-hack-berlin) at Google HQ, sponsored by many other key AI companies, which also formed the jury. The agent can fully control a [Unix-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) machine, therefore perform any task a human agent could do with such a system.

## The challenge

* Organizations increasingly need AI expertise but face high costs for specialized talent
* Small organizations struggle to access AI capabilities that could help them thrive
* Current AI agents are [limited to specific workflows rather than being true autonomous agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
* Make AI fully *see* our organizations, and autonomously decide on using tools to improve what has been discovered

---
### Examples of what Claudine can do

- research the internet, call APIs
- write and update documents and contracts
- exchange information with 3rd parties
- administer OS, Cloud, Databases, etc.
- develop complete software products
- self-modify by coding new tools for itself
- etc. - the sky is the limit

---
### How Claudine came into being?
* Developed through independent research in philosophy and cognitive science ([Xemantic collective](https://xemantic.com))
* Built on years of experience in software development, architecture, system administration, and working with NGOs
* The whole [ecosystem of open source tools](https://xemantic.com/ai/) has been developed to make Claudine possible

* Limited availability (unavailable in Germany, and many other regions)
* Our advantage: Open architecture, educational focus, immediate availability

---
## Pricing Strategy

* Open-source core (GPL licensed)
* Premium support and consulting services
* Educational workshops and training programs
* Custom development and integration services

---
## Value Proposition

* Immediate ROI through productivity gains
* Reduced dependency on expensive specialists
* Access to cutting-edge AI capabilities
* Educational and community benefits

---
## Core Technology

* Built on Anthropic's Claude model
* Custom Kotlin multiplatform implementation
* Integrated agentic framework

---
## AI Implementation

* Custom Anthropic SDK development
* In-house developed agentic framework
* Uses structured output and semantic input
* Specialized testing infrastructure

## IP Protection

* Core technology open-sourced under GPL
* Proprietary extensions possible
* Ecosystem tools with separate licensing

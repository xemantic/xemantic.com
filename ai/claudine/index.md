# Claudine AI agent

## About Claudine

Claudine ([source](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine/)) is an open source research prototype of an autonomous and **omnipotent** AI agent, which already won highly competitive [AI hack Berlin hackathon](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/ai-hack-berlin) at Google HQ, sponsored by many other key AI companies, which also formed the jury. The agent can fully control a [Unix-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) machine, therefore perform any task a human agent could do with such a system.

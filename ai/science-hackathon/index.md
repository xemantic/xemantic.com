## Call for Collaboration: Exploring AI-Augmented Scientific Research

Artificial intelligence has evolved dramatically—today's advanced reasoning AI agents can now develop complete software products and significantly enhance scientific research.

[Xemantic](https://xemantic.com/), a collective of applied philosophy founded by Julia Thomas and Kazik Pogoda, is seeking scientists interested in evaluating how Agentic AI can support their research fields. As creators of award-winning AI agents, we're proposing a hackathon and coding jam where scientists could collaborate with AI experts to test the quality and effectiveness of AI-conducted research.

We can offer:

- Expertise in Machine Learning and AI development ([Claudine](https://github.com/xemantic/claudine/) AI agent, Anthropic API, Model Context Protocol)
- A collaborative testing ground for AI-research applications
- Potential venue at [Prachtsaal](https://prachtsaal.berlin/), our experimental cultural center in Neukölln

If you're a scientist curious about the untapped potential of AI in your research, we'd like to hear from you. This is an opportunity to explore the intersection of human expertise and artificial intelligence in advancing scientific discovery.

## Agentic AI

What makes an AI agent, **the difference between "a workflow" and "an agent"**:

https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents

---
## Why Anthropic?

* Claude Sonnet 3.5 - the first model which made truly autonomous agentic use cases feasible (SWE-Bench) 
* They just dropped Claude 3.7

_We invested in building anthropic-sdk-kotlin, good intuition regarding who will lead the AI race._

## AI agents from JetBrains

* Claude Desktop + [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/i)
* [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/)

_JetBrains delivered [IntelliJ MCP Server](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26071-mcp-server) +
[MDC/kotlin-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)._

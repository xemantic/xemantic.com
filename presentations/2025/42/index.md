## What is "cognition"

Cognition defines reasoning process in abstraction from the biological substrate:

- carbon (biological)
- silicon (tech)
- alien (sci-fi)

_Cognitive science is focused on defining models of mind regardless of what makes the "mind"_

---
## Is LLM a cognitive machine?

Very controversial topic:

- Apple: [The Illusion of Thinking](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking)
- OpenAI: next model will be AGI
- Singularity
- Teilhard de Chardin

---
## About metacognition

Metacognition: the ability of "thinking about own thinking".

Attributed to humans and many animal species.

_In popular culture called self-consciousness_

Premise: necessary for achieving "AGI"

---
## About Golem XIV

> Golem XIV is a fictional AI character from the book of Stanisław Lem (the author of Solaris). In the 1980s Lem predicted "AGI" in 2027-2029. It's the most difficult book I've ever read, written from the perspective of superintelligence lecturing humankind.
